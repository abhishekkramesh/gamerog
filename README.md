Master: The Master tier is the gateway to the exclusive realms of high-level play, where competition becomes increasingly intense.

Grandmaster: Grandmaster is an even more exclusive tier, reserved for players who are at the peak of their game, and the skill level is extraordinary.

Challenger: The Challenger tier represents the pinnacle of ranked play, featuring the best players in the region who consistently vie for mastery.
